//! Per-client event adapters.
//!
//! Each external agent (Claude Code today, other agents later) speaks its own
//! event vocabulary. An adapter converts one raw event payload into a uniform
//! [`AdapterOutput`] that `http_server` then applies to `AppState`.
//!
//! Adding a new client = new submodule + a match arm in [`dispatch`]. The HTTP
//! route never changes.
